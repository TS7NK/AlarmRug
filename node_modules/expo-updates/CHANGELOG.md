## 0.4.1 — 2020-11-25

### 🛠 Breaking changes

- This version adds an internal database migration, which means that when a user's device upgrades from an app with `expo-updates@0.3.x` to an app with `expo-updates@0.4.x`, any updates they had previously downloaded will no longer be accessible.
  -   For **managed workflow apps**, this is inconsequential as this upgrade will be part of a major SDK version upgrade. You do not need to do anything if your app is made using the managed workflow.
  -   For **bare workflow apps**, this means updates downloaded on clients running `expo-updates@0.3.x` will need to be redownloaded in order to run after those clients are upgraded to `expo-updates@0.4.x`. We recommend incrementing your runtime/SDK version after updating to `expo-updates@0.4.x`, and republishing any OTA updates that you do not intend to distribute embedded in your application binary.

## 0.4.0 — 2020-11-17

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- Fixed issue in **managed workflow** where `reloadAsync` doesn't reload the app if called immediately after the app starts. ([#10917](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/10917) and [#10918](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/10918) by [@esamelson](https://github.com/esamelson))

## 0.3.0 — 2020-08-18

### 🎉 New features

## 0.2.12 — 2020-07-24

- Fetch asset manifest through programmatic CLI interface instead of depending on a running React Native CLI server, so `./gradlew :app:assembleRelease` works as expected without needing to run `react-native start` beforehand. ([#9372](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/9372)).

## 0.2.11 — 2020-06-29

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where the publish workflow was broken on Android. Note that the publish workflow will not be supported in a future version of expo-updates, so we recommend [switching to the no-publish workflow](https://blog.expo.io/over-the-air-updates-from-expo-are-now-even-easier-to-use-376e2213fabf).

## 0.2.10 — 2020-06-23

- Improved the error message logged when an embedded manifest cannot be found.

## 0.2.9 — 2020-06-15

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- Fixed issue where launch screen on iOS doesn't show whilst updates are being retrieved if it is contained within a storyboard instead of a nib. ([#8750](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/8750) by [@MattsTheChief](https://github.com/MattsTheChief))
- Fixed an issue where the REACT_NATIVE_PACKAGER_HOSTNAME env var was not respected in the build scripts for iOS or Android.

- Added a more helpful error message when trying to run a build without the packager server running.

## 0.2.3

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- Temporarily vendor `filterPlatformAssetScales` method from `@react-native-community/cli` in order to fix builds when `npm` was used to install dependencies (rather than `yarn`).
- Fixed an issue on iOS where calling the JS module methods in development mode, after publishing at least one update, would crash the app.

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue on iOS where expo-updates expected more assets to be embedded than actually are by the React Native CLI.
- Added a better error message on iOS when embedded assets are missing.

## 0.2.1

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- Added a better error message to the `createManifest` script when project does not have the `hashAssetFiles` plugin configured.

## 0.2.0

### 🎉 New features

- Added support for the **no-publish workflow**. In this workflow, release builds of both iOS and Android apps will create and embed a new update at build-time from the JS code currently on disk, rather than embedding a copy of the most recently published update. For more information, along with upgrade instructions if you're upgrading from 0.1.x and would like to use the no-publish workflow, read [this blog post](https://blog.expo.io/over-the-air-updates-from-expo-are-now-even-easier-to-use-376e2213fabf).
