## 0.8.0 ‚Äî 2020-11-17

### üõ† Breaking changes

- Changed the way `PermissionResponse.status` is calculated on iOS. Previously, it returns the numeric value of `UMPermissionStatus` which does not match the TypeScript enum declaration. ([#10513](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/10513) by [@cHaLkdusT](https://github.com/cHaLkdusT))
- Changed the way `NotificationContent.data` is calculated on iOS. Previously it was the contents of remote notification payload with all entries from under `"body"` moved from under `"body"` to root level. Now it's the sole unchanged contents of `payload["body"]`. Other fields of the payload can now be accessed on iOS through `PushNotificationTrigger.payload` (similarly to how other fields of native remote message can be accessed on Android under `PushNotificationTrigger.remoteMessage`). ([#10453](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/10453) by [@sjchmiela](https://github.com/sjchmiela))
- Changed class responsible for handling Firebase events from `FirebaseMessagingService` to `.service.NotificationsService` on Android. ([#10558](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/10558) by [@sjchmiela](https://github.com/sjchmiela))

  > Note that this change most probably will not affect you ‚Äî it only affects projects that override `FirebaseMessagingService` to implement some custom handling logic.
- Changed how you can override ways in which a notification is reinterpreted from a [`StatusBarNotification`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/notification/StatusBarNotification) and in which a [`Notification`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification.html?hl=en) is built from defining an `expo.modules.notifications#NotificationsScoper` meta-data value in `AndroidManifest.xml` to implementing a `BroadcastReceiver` subclassing `NotificationsService` delegating those responsibilities to your custom `PresentationDelegate` instance. ([#10558](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/10558) by [@sjchmiela](https://github.com/sjchmiela))

  > Note that this change most probably will not affect you ‚Äî it only affects projects that override those methods to implement some custom handling logic.
- Removed `removeAllNotificationListeners` method. You can (and should) still remove listeners using `remove` method on `Subscription` objects returned by `addNotification‚Ä¶Listener`. ([#10883](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/10883) by [@sjchmiela](https://github.com/sjchmiela))
- Fixed device identifier being used to fetch Expo push token being backed up on Android which resulted in multiple devices having the same `deviceId` (and eventually, Expo push token). ([#11005](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/11005) by [@sjchmiela](https://github.com/sjchmiela))
- Fixed device identifier used when fetching Expo push token being different than `Constants.installationId` in managed workflow apps which resulted in different Expo push tokens returned for the same experience across old and new Expo API and the device push token not being automatically updated on Expo push servers which lead to Expo push tokens corresponding to outdated Firebase tokens. ([#11005](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/11005) by [@sjchmiela](https://github.com/sjchmiela))
- Removed `removeAllPushTokenListeners` method. You can (and should) still remove listeners using `remove` method on `Subscription` objects returned by `addPushTokenListener`. ([#11106](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/11106) by [@sjchmiela](https://github.com/sjchmiela))

### üéâ New features

- Added `useLastNotificationResponse` React hook that always returns the notification response that has been emitted most recently. ([#10883](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/10883) by [@sjchmiela](https://github.com/sjchmiela))
- Added `WeeklyTriggerInput` that allows scheduling a weekly recurring notification for a specific day of week, hour and minute. It is supported on both iOS and Android. ([#9973](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/9973) by [@RikTheunis](https://github.com/riktheunis))
- Added `getNextTriggerDateAsync` method allowing you to verify manually when would the next trigger date for a particular notification trigger be. ([#10455](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/10455) by [@sjchmiela](https://github.com/sjchmiela))
- Added support for restoring scheduled notifications alarms on Android after an app is updated. ([#10708](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/10708) by [@sjchmiela](https://github.com/sjchmiela))
- Added support for auto server reregistration for Expo push tokens (keeping Expo push token always valid) and auto server registration customizations. ([#10908](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/10908) by [@sjchmiela](https://github.com/sjchmiela))

### üêõ Bug fixes

- Fixed TypeScript definition: `setNotificationCategoryAsync` should expect `options.allowAnnouncement`, **not** `options.allowAnnouncment`. ([#11025](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/11025) by [@cruzach](https://github.com/cruzach))
- Fixed issue where custom notification icon and color weren't being properly applied in Android managed workflow apps. ([#10828](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/10828) by [@cruzach](https://github.com/cruzach))
- Fixed case where Android managed workflow apps could crash when receiving an interactive notification. ([#10608](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/10608) by [@cruzach](https://github.com/cruzach))
- Fixed case where Android apps could crash if you set a new category with a text input action **without** providing any `options`. ([#10141](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/10141) by [@cruzach](https://github.com/cruzach))
- Android apps no longer rely on the `submitButtonTitle` property as the action button title (they rely on `buttonTitle`, which matches iOS behavior). ([#10141](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/10141) by [@cruzach](https://github.com/cruzach))
- Fixed `Notifications.requestPermissions()` returning `undetermined` instead of a known status in some browsers. ([#10296](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/10296) by [@sjchmiela](https://github.com/sjchmiela))
- Fixed crashing when Proguard is enabled. ([#10421](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/10421) by [@lukmccall](https://github.com/lukmccall))
- Fixed the application icon being always added as a notification icon. ([#10471](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/10471) by [@lukmccall](https://github.com/lukmccall))
- Fixed faulty trigger detection mechanism which caused some triggers with `channelId` specified get recognized as triggers of other types. ([#10454](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/10454) by [@sjchmiela](https://github.com/sjchmiela))
- Fixed fatal exception sometimes being thrown when notification was received or tapped on Android due to observer being cleared before it's added. ([#10640](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/10640) by [@sjchmiela](https://github.com/sjchmiela))
- Removed the large icon from managed workflow. ([#10492](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/10492) by [@lukmccall](https://github.com/lukmccall))
- Fixed crash happening due to non-existent `ExpoNotificationsService` being declared in `AndroidManifest.xml`. ([#10638](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/10638) by [@sjchmiela](https://github.com/sjchmiela))
- Fixed notifications _not_ playing any sound when `shouldShowAlert: false` but `shouldPlaySound: true` in `setNotificationHandler`. ([#10699](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/10699) by [@cruzach](https://github.com/cruzach))
- Add guard against badgin usage in SSR environments. ([#10741](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/10741) by [@bycedric](https://github.com/bycedric))
- Moved notification events handling from main thread to a background thread which makes users' devices more responsive. ([#10762](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/10762) by [@sjchmiela](https://github.com/sjchmiela))
- Fixed having to define `CATEGORY_DEFAULT` on an `Activity` that is expected to receive `expo.modules.notifications.OPEN_APP_ACTION` intent when handling notification response. ([#10755](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/10755) by [@sjchmiela](https://github.com/sjchmiela))
- Fixed notifications not being returned at all from `getAllPresentedNotificationsAsync()` if the library fails to reconstruct notification request based on marshaled copy in notification data. From now on they'll be naively reconstructed from the Android notification. ([#10801](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/10801) by [@sjchmiela](https://github.com/sjchmiela))
- May have helped fix an issue where "initial notification response" (the one that opened the app) was not being delivered to Android apps. ([#10773](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/10773) by [@sjchmiela](https://github.com/sjchmiela))

## 0.4.0 ‚Äî 2020-06-24

### üéâ New features

- Added `IosAuthorizationStatus.EPHEMERAL`, an option that maps to `UNAuthorizationStatusEphemeral` for compatibility with iOS 14. ([#8938](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/8938) by [@ide](https://github.com/ide))

### üêõ Bug fixes

- Fixed total incompatibility with the web platform ‚Äì calling unsupported methods will now throw a readable `UnavailabilityError`. ([#8853](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/8853) by [@sjchmiela](https://github.com/sjchmiela))

## 0.3.2 ‚Äî 2020-06-10

### üêõ Bug fixes

- Fixed compatibility with `expo-permissions` below `9.0.0` (the _duplicate symbols_ problem). ([#8753](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/8753) by [@sjchmiela](https://github.com/sjchmiela))

## 0.3.1 ‚Äî 2020-06-03

### üéâ New features

- Added support for including foreign (non-`expo-notifications`-created) notifications in `getPresentedNotificationsAsync` on Android. ([#8614](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/8614) by [@sjchmiela](https://github.com/sjchmiela))

### üêõ Bug fixes

  > Note that the effect of this method is the same as if you called `Notifications.getPermissionsAsync()` (or `requestPermissionsAsync`) and then `Notifications.getDevicePushTokenAsync()`‚Äîit tries to both ask the user for user-facing notifications permissions and then tries to register the device for remote notifications. We are planning to deprecate the `.NOTIFICATIONS` permission soon.

## 0.2.0 ‚Äî 2020-05-27

### üõ† Breaking changes

- > Note that this may or may not be a breaking change for you ‚Äî if you'd expect the notification to be automatically dismissed when tapped on this is a bug fix and a new feature (fixes inconsistency between platforms as on iOS this is the only supported behavior; adds the ability to customize the behavior on Android). If you'd expect the notification to only be dismissed at your will this is a breaking change and you'll need to add `autoDismiss: false` to your notification content inputs.
Changed the default notification behavior on Android to be automatically dismissed when clicked. This is customizable with the `autoDismiss` parameter of `NotificationContentInput`. ([#8241](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/8241) by [@thorbenprimke](https://github.com/thorbenprimke))

- Fixed notification content text being truncated without the ability to expand the notification by adding [`BigTextStyle`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification.BigTextStyle) to all Android notifications, which allows them to be expanded and their content text fully viewed ([#8140](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/8140) by [@thorbenprimke](https://github.com/thorbenprimke))
- Added a check for trigger input that throws an error if user misuses the `seconds` property ([#8261](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/8261) by [@sjchmiela](https://github.com/sjchmiela))

## 0.1.2 - 2020-04-21

### üêõ Bug fixes
